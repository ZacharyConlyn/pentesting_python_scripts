# Pentesting Python Scripts

This repo is a collection of Python scripts adapted from those found in the books Violent Python and Blackhat Python. They have been updated to work with Python 3.7, and in some cases have added functionality, modularity, or resiliance to errors.

Some updates/changes to the original scripts:

 * All scripts are tested on Python 3.7
 * Scripts now conform (mostly) to PEP8 style guides
 * Type hint have been added to all functions
 * Password dictionary files are loaded lazily with generators
 * Older libraries have been replaced with modern equivalents (e.g. optparse -> argparse, pxssh -> paramiko)
 * Threading has been implemented with thread pools
 * Many other miscelaneous improvements

 I want to add this is not a slight on the original author's Python skills. The context of the original scripts were as quick-and-dirty tools, written as one-offs or in live pentest situations.
